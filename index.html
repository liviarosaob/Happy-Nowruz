        <p>Dear Ash,</p>
        <p>As for the iranian’s new year and for my first attempt at making a website EVER, I decided to dedicate it to you.</p>
        <p>From what I understood about the Nowruz, it symbolizes a time for growth and renewal, and I wish that for you. May the most beautiful gifts from life blossom in you, forever and always, and may this new year be, for you, a time of happiness and peace, like the arrival of spring is (and, in your case, not just an allergy caller).</p>
        <p>Last year was very chaotic for me, and I think you’ll never quite understand how grateful and happy I felt for having met you. You, for being you, bring me joy. And, for this year, I wish all the good feelings you give and gave me return to you. I know you’ll feel blessed, because I do.</p>
        <p>I really hope you can always find peace, love, and a new reason to be grateful and keep going. I'm sending my best intentions for you and your family.</p>
        <p>Happy Nowruz! 🌱🌷</p>
